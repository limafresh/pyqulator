> The project is archived. It starts slowly compared to C/C++ calculators like MATE Calculator, KCalc, etc. And there are many calculators in the world - each device, each OS has a pre-installed one, and there is no need to develop another one, especially separately. It has never had a single user or contributor - so I have the moral right to archive it. This repository will be useful for those who want to get acquainted with the creation of a calculator and packaging in .deb. :)

A fully functional Qt calculator written in Python using Sympy for calculations. The interface was created using Qt Designer and Qt Linguist.
